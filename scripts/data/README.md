# Data Management Scripts

This directory contains data management scripts.

## Note

For data collection, use the CLI command:
```bash
upbit-quant collect --tickers KRW-BTC KRW-ETH --intervals day week
```

The `data_collector.py` script is kept for backward compatibility but the CLI is recommended.
